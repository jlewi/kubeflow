# Kubeflow Ksonnet Registry

## Overview

This directory contains the Kubeflow ksonnet [registry][2]. If you are unfamiliar with ksonnet, we recommend browsing [the official site][1] to gain more context.


## Usage

Please refer to the [Kubeflow user guide](https://github.com/google/kubeflow/blob/master/README.ksonnet.md)

## Library-specific Documentation

Each of the libraries in this directory has its own README.md. These are autogenerated from the metadata in their `parts.yaml` file, using the [`doc-gen` script][4].

Note that you can use the `ks` commands in your terminal to access this same documentation.
