# Kubeflow Ksonnet Registry

## Overview

This directory contains the Kubeflow ksonnet  [registry][2]. If you are unfamiliar with ksonnet, we recommend browsing [the official site][1] to gain more context.

TODO(jlewi): Add instructions for adding this registry to ks once its supported.

TODO(jlewi): We should probably rename this registry. We named it incubator because ksonnet doesn't support adding registries. So we use our registry
by having ksonnet use our registry as the default. Therefore we decided to mimic the structure/naming of the default registry to minimize issues.

## Usage

Assuming that you have the `ks` tool [installed][3], you can use any library in this registry as follows, by replacing `redis` with `<library-name>`:

```
# List all available packages (e.g. jupyterhub, TfJob controller, ...)
ks pkg list

# Describe a specific package
ks pkg describe kubeflow/core@master

# Download a specific package
ks pkg install kubeflow/core@master
```

## Library-specific Documentation

Each of the libraries in this directory has its own README.md. These are autogenerated from the metadata in their `parts.yaml` file, using the [`doc-gen` script][4].

Note that you can use the `ks` commands in your terminal to access this same documentation.
